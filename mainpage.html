<h2>Military police (MPs) deal with crimes committed on military property or any illegal activity involving members of the Guard. Trained as Soldiers and police officers, MPs play a crucial role in conducting traffic control, corrections, security and mobility support. To keep Soldiers and their property safe, MPs are instructed in area security operations, which includes forced protection, anti-terror and crime prevention functions.
<br><br>
In the event of a disaster, military police act alongside local law enforcement and first responders. MPs rescue those in need or detain civilians who are breaking the law. MPs assist, protect and defend while upholding the rule of law.</h2>
